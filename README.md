# Object-Classification-using-deep-learning
Object detection using deep learning is basically processing of image frames by using deep learning algorithms. In this, we are going to train a model for various kinds of objects such as person, car, truck, bus, bicycle, bike, stop sign, parking meter and traffic signal and by using that trained model we are classifying the objects as per their behaviors and characteristics. Objects are detected at an approximate 35-45 meter distance. If two or more objects are detected at same instance, the driver is notified via buzzing the buzzer.
